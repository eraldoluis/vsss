Thanks for trying out LibPG.
This script has been provided for peoply that just can't help typing
$ ./configure
$ ./make
But just to let you know, all I'm going to do is 'cp Makefile.default Makefile'.

This might work for you if you have the latest version of Boost 
in a normal place. Otherwise, please edit the resulting Makefile 
and consider reading README.txt.

cp -i Makefile.default Makefile
